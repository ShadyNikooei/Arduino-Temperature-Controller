# Arduino Temperature Controller

A simple yet practical project that uses an Arduino UNO to automatically control the ambient temperature. This system reads the temperature from a sensor, displays it on a 7-segment display, and controls a cooling fan and a heater based on predefined thresholds.

## Features

-   **Live Temperature Display:** Shows the current ambient temperature in Celsius on two 7-segment displays.
-   **Automatic Fan Control:** If the temperature rises above 30째C, the cooling fan turns on automatically and stays on until the temperature drops back to 25째C.
-   **Automatic Heater Control:** If the temperature falls below 20째C, the heater turns on automatically and stays on until the temperature rises back to 25째C.
-   **LED Simulation:** The fan and heater operations are simulated using two distinct LEDs.
-   **Serial Data Output:** Continuously sends temperature data to the computer, which can be visualized using the Arduino Serial Plotter.

## Getting Started

1.  **Hardware Setup:** Assemble the circuit on a breadboard according to the wiring diagram.
2.  **Software Setup:**
    * Open the project's `.ino` file in the **Arduino IDE**.
    * Connect your Arduino Uno board to your computer.
    * Select the correct Board and Port from the `Tools` menu.
3.  **Upload:** Click the **Upload** button to flash the program onto your board.

The system will start working automatically after the upload is complete. You can test its functionality by heating or cooling the temperature sensor and observing the LEDs and the 7-segment display.
